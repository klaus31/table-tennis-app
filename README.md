# Table Tennis App

Put your smartphone in the middle of a table tennis table (under the net) here:

```
┏━━━━━━┯━━━━━━┓
┃      │      ┃  
┃      │      ┃  
┃      │      ┃  
┣X━━━━━┿━━━━━━┫
┃      │      ┃  
┃      │      ┃  
┃      │      ┃  
┗━━━━━━┷━━━━━━┛
```

Step 1: Start this app  
Step 2: Start the warming up (at least until the app say "I am ready")
Step 3: Tell the app you are starting a match  
Step 4: Let the app count the score for you! The app will tell you, who have to serve next and when to change the side of the table.


## What is working so far?

Absolutely nothing - this is just an idea yet


## Will it ever work?

Never ever with 100 % precision (e.g. netcords are almost impossible to recognize).

But there will be possibilities to correct wrong scores (like knocking three times on your side of the table will give the point to you). 

How often you will have to do that? I do not know - let's find out!


## System requirements

You will need a microphone and a speaker on your smartphone. How good the mic has to be? I do not know yet. The speaker is just to tell you the score. You can have also a look at your smartphone - but that's not comfortable.

And of course you need a table, a ball and two bats. 

### The requirements of the table? 

I do not know yet. But the more the sound of the ball touching a side differ from the other side, the better it will work.

### The requirements of the ball? 

Nothing special. But the app will may get trouble when changing the ball (we will see).

### The requirements of the bats? 

Hopefully nothing special. But like the table, different sounds may get helpful.

### Weather requirements? 

You won't play your match outside on a rainy and stormy day, will you? Bad idea ...

But even on a sunny day the app will may get problems with a breeze on your mic (we will see).

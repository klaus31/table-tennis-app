# Table Tennis App

Put your smartphone in the middle of a table tennis table (under the net) here:

```
┏━━━━━━┯━━━━━━┓
┃      │      ┃  
┃      │      ┃  
┃      │      ┃  
┣X━━━━━┿━━━━━━┫
┃      │      ┃  
┃      │      ┃  
┃      │      ┃  
┗━━━━━━┷━━━━━━┛
```

Step 1: Start this app  
Step 2: Start the warming up (at least until the app say "I am ready")  
Step 3: Tell the app you are starting a match  
Step 4: Let the app count the score for you! The app will tell you, who have to serve next and when to change the side of the table.


## What is working so far?

Absolutely nothing written so far


## Will it ever work?

Never ever with 100 % precision (e.g. on netcords it is almost impossible to recognize, on which side the ball landed).

But there will be possibilities to correct wrong scores (like knocking three times on your side of the table will give the point to you). 

How often you will have to do that? I do not know yet - let's find out!


## System requirements

I do not know the requirements yet. But here are some thoughts on it.

### The requirements of the phone? 

You will need a microphone and a speaker on your smartphone. How good the mic has to be? I do not know yet. The speaker is just to tell you the score. 

Alternatively to the speaker you can have a look at the display - but that is not comfortable.

OS question: It is far away to get the software on a phone. But since it is written in java, Android is the nearest candidate.

### The requirements of the table? 

I do not know yet. But the more the sound of the ball touching a side differ from the other side, the better it will work.

### The requirements of the ball? 

Nothing special. But the app will may get trouble when changing the ball (we will see).

### The requirements of the bats? 

Hopefully nothing special. But like the table, different sounds may get helpful.

### Weather requirements? 

You won't play your match outside on a rainy and stormy day, will you?

But even on a sunny day the app will may get problems with a breeze on the mic (we will find out as well).

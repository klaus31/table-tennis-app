/**
 * Testing example rallies and matches.
 * These are very special integration tests - a mix of automatic testing and explorative researches.
 *
 * ATTENTION: Tests make noise on your computer to test the analysis of the noise on the fly (like it will be in the final app).<br>
 * This means:<br>
 * You are listening to music? Tests will fail!<br>
 * Machine is not able to make noise? Tests will fail!<br>
 * E-Mail sound while testing? Tests will fail!
 *
 * There might be more reasons! What I meant to say: Tests in this package are unstable by design.
 *
 * TODO configure possibility to run these tests separately from unit tests.
